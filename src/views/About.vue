        <p>We’re reimagining <span>grooming</span></p>

        <p>Groom Club is the first mobile grooming service developed by veterinarians. We’re reimagining grooming to make it
            easy for pet parents to give their best friend the long, healthy life they deserve.</p>

    <div>
        <!-- image -->

        <p>We get on the <span>floor</span></p>

        <p>We believe that trust is earned, and we demonstrate this by getting on the floor. We establish a genuine
            connection with our four-legged members and prioritize their needs.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Happy team, <span>healthy members</span></p>

        <p>We champion the wellbeing and career growth of our team members. We build an environment founded on empathy, open
            communication, and compassion.</p>

        <p>Details <span>matter</span></p>

        <p>Precision and attention to detail are our cornerstones. We establish clear expectations, follow through on
            promises, and always act in the best interests of our members and their parents.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Own<span>it</span></p>

        <p>Everything we do—from how we conduct ourselves with pet parents to the cleanliness of our facilities and
            everything in between—is to provide the highest standard of care. When we encounter an unmet need, we step up
            and own it.</p>

            balance that respects their expertise and dedication</p>
